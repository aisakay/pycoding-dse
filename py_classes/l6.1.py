# we want to implement the Wordle game
# https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

# you have X attempts to guess the target word that is randomly selected within the 5-letter words in English

# rules:
## A correct letter turns green
## A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow
## An incorrect letter turns gray

# for any attempt, the feedback must report green-yellow-gray letters
# use tiles to provide a feedback (see the pic in the attachment)


# cases to handle (with a message to the player)
# words that are not in the dictionary
# words with length different from 5
# words already guessed (do not consume tries, we need a history)

# check_guess returns colored letters and colored tiles that are the feedback on a letter-by-letter comparison of guess against target
# this solution is not completely satisfactory. There are cases where the letters are not properly colored (can you find a solution?). Example:
# guess: canal
# target: medal

    # global means that a variable defined in the main code is visible and accessible in the function scope
